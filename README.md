This project was completed as part of CS252: Mathematical Data Analysis and Visualization at Colby College. It is a supervised learning project making an email spam filter, which is implemented using K-nearest neighbors and Naive Bayes.

To view email preprocessing code: epp_stopwords.py
To view Naive Bayes implementation: naive_bayes.py
To view KNN implementation: knn.py
To view results and comparisons between the two methods: naive_bayes.ipynb
